The food was yet to be served and my appetite roared for something at the height of a classic Peruvian meal with an innovative punch of colorful flavors. What arrived at the table was nothing far from mediocre. A seafood chaufa montadito, however, stood proudly at the forefront of the menu with delectable notes of smoked ginger, a delicate drizzle of sesame oil, and a fluffy shrimp omelet to top a flavorful dish. From the leche de tigre, which could have used more freshness to cut the acidity, all the way to the súper jalea criolla, that could benefit from a crunchier exterior, the items were plentiful but boring. A lack of creativity and originality abounded and overshadowed any sort of culinary dexterity on the part of the kitchen. At a moment when all of it felt at a loss, appeared on the wooden tabletop what was perhaps the most interesting dish of the visit, a palatable take on a pejerrey fish sandwich that both satisfied and amused, a flamboyant amalgam of textures tucked between a flaky sourdough."}, {three: "On a second visit, redemption took place in the form of fresh choros a la chalaca, a dish in celebration of the restaurant’s own concept, but almost all other thoughts were immediately confirmed. Barra Chalaca once again presented something well within the ordinary confines of our remarkable cuisine; a proposal full of flavor and abundance but with too few sparks of gastronomic inventiveness."}, {four: ""}], restaurant: [{gastro_rating: 2.5}, {nomad_rating: 0}, {price: 40}, {address: "Camino Real 1239, San Isidro"}, {phone: "422-1465"}, {website: "https://www.facebook.com/BarraChalacaPeru/"}, {date: "March 22, 2017"}]});
